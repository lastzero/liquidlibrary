+ Wiki Syntax

++ General Notes

The markup described on this page is for the default Text_Wiki rules; it is a combination of the [http://tavi.sourceforge.net WikkTikkiTavi] and [http://develnet.org/ coWiki] markup styles.

All text is entered as plain text, and will be converted to HTML entities as necessary.  This means that {{<}}, {{>}}, {{&}}, and so on are converted for you (except in special situations where the characters are Wiki markup; Text_Wiki is generally smart enough to know when to convert and when not to).

Just hit "return" twice to make a paragraph break.  If you want to keep the same logical line but have to split it across two physical lines (such as when your editor only shows a certain number of characters per line), end the line with a backslash {{}} and hit return once.  This will cause the two lines to be joined on display, and the backslash will not show.  (If you end a line with a backslash and a tab or space, it will ''not'' be joined with the next line, and the backslash will be printed.)

++ Inline Formatting

|| {{``//emphasis text//``}}                 || //emphasis text// ||
|| {{``**strong text**``}}                   || **strong text** ||
|| {{``//**emphasis and strong**//``}}       || //**emphasis and strong**// ||
|| {{``{{teletype text}}``}}                    || {{teletype text}} ||
|| {{``@@--- delete text +++ insert text @@``}} || @@--- delete text +++ insert text @@ ||
|| {{``@@--- delete only @@``}}                 || @@--- delete only @@ ||
|| {{``@@+++ insert only @@``}}                 || @@+++ insert only @@ ||

++ Literal Text

If you don't want Text_Wiki to parse some text, enclose it in two backticks (not single-quotes).

<code>
This //text// gets **parsed**.
``This //text// does not get **parsed**.``
</code>

This //text// gets **parsed**.
``This //text// does not get **parsed**.``

++ Headings

You can make various levels of heading by putting equals-signs before and after the text (all on its own line):

<code>
+++ Level 3 Heading
++++ Level 4 Heading
+++++ Level 5 Heading
++++++ Level 6 Heading
</code>

+++ Level 3 Heading
++++ Level 4 Heading
+++++ Level 5 Heading
++++++ Level 6 Heading

++ Horizontal Rules

Use four dashes ({{``----``}}) to create a horizontal rule.

++ Lists

+++ Bullet Lists

You can create bullet lists by starting a paragraph with one or 
more asterisks.

<code>
* Bullet one
 * Sub-bullet
</code>

* Bullet one
 * Sub-bullet

+++ Numbered Lists

Similarly, you can create numbered lists by starting a paragraph 
with one or more hashes.

<code>
# Numero uno
# Number two
 # Sub-item
</code>

# Numero uno
# Number two
 # Sub-item


+++ Mixing Bullet and Number List Items

You can mix and match bullet and number lists:

<code>
# Number one
 * Bullet
 * Bullet
# Number two
 * Bullet
 * Bullet
  * Sub-bullet
   # Sub-sub-number
   # Sub-sub-number
# Number three
 * Bullet
 * Bullet
</code>

# Number one
 * Bullet
 * Bullet
# Number two
 * Bullet
 * Bullet
  * Sub-bullet
   # Sub-sub-number
   # Sub-sub-number
# Number three
 * Bullet
 * Bullet

+++ Definition Lists

You can create a definition (description) list with the following syntax:

<code>
: Item 1 : Something
: Item 2 : Something else
</code>

: Item 1 : Something
: Item 2 : Something else

++ Block Quotes

You can mark a blockquote by starting a line with one or more '>' 
characters, followed by a space and the text to be quoted.

<code>
This is normal text here.

> Indent me! The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.  
Now this the time for all good men to come to the aid of  
their country. Notice how we can continue the block-quote  
in the same "paragraph" by using a backslash at the end of  
the line.
>
> Another block, leading to...
>> Second level of indenting.  This second is indented even  
more than the previous one.

Back to normal text.
</code>

++ Links and Images

+++ Wiki Links

Use a shortcut to create a page link:
<code>
[[[Wiki page name|Optional Title]]]
</code>

+++ URLs

Create a remote link simply by typing its URL: http://ciaweb.net.

If you like, enclose it in brackets to create a numbered reference 
and avoid cluttering the page; {{``[http://ciaweb.net/free/]``}} becomes [http://ciaweb.net/free/].

Or you can have a described-reference instead of a numbered reference:
<code>
[http://pear.php.net PEAR]
</code>
[http://pear.php.net PEAR]

++ Images
[[image:wiki_150x150.png|right|Title]]
You can put a picture in a page by using an image shortcut:
<code>
[[[image:wiki_150x150.png|right|Title]]]
</code>

++ Code Blocks

Create code blocks by using {{<code>...</code>}} tags (each on its own line).

<code>
This is an example code block!
</code>


To create PHP blocks that get automatically colorized when you use PHP tags, simply surround the code with {{<code type="php">...</code>}} tags (the tags themselves should each be on their own lines, and no need for the {{<?php ... ?>}} tags).

<code>
 <code type="php">
 // Set up the wiki options
 $options = array();
 $options['view_url'] = "index.php?page=";

 // load the text for the requested page
 $text = implode('', file($page . '.wiki.txt'));

 // create a Wiki objext with the loaded options
 $wiki = new Text_Wiki($options);

 // transform the wiki text.
 echo $wiki->transform($text);
 </code>
</code>

<code type="php">
// Set up the wiki options
$options = array();
$options['view_url'] = "index.php?page=";

// load the text for the requested page
$text = implode('', file($page . '.wiki.txt'));

// create a Wiki objext with the loaded options
$wiki = new Text_Wiki($options);

// transform the wiki text.
echo $wiki->transform($text);
</code>

++ Tables

You can create tables using pairs of vertical bars:

<code>
|| cell one || cell two ||
|||| big ol' line ||
|| cell four || cell five ||
|| cell six || here's a very long cell ||
</code>

|| cell one || cell two ||
|||| big ol' line ||
|| cell four || cell five ||
|| cell six || here's a very long cell ||

<code>
||~ lines must start and end ||~ with double vertical bars ||~ nothing ||
|| cells are separated by || double vertical bars || nothing ||
|||| you can span multiple columns by || starting each cell ||
|| with extra cell |||| separators ||
|||||| but perhaps an example is the easiest way to see ||
